;;; 1.  Create a calculator that takes one argument: a list that represents an expression.

;;; 2. Expand the calculator's operation to allow for arguments that are themselves well-formed arithmetic expressions.


(write (calculate '(ADD 3 4))) (newline) ;; --> 7
(write (calculate '(ADD 3 (MUL 4 5)))) (newline) ;; --> 23   ;; what is the equivalent construction using list?
(write (calculate '(SUB (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6)))) (newline);; --> -23

;;; 3. Add comparators returning booleans (*e.g.*, greater than, less than, â€¦).
;; Note that each of these takes numeric arguments (or expressions that evaluate to produce numeric values),
;; but returns a boolean.  We suggest operators `GT`, `LT`, `GE`, `LE`, `EQ`, `NEQ`.

(write (calculate '(GT (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6)))) (newline) ;; --> #f
(write (calculate '(LE (ADD 3 (MUL 4 5)) (SUB 0 (SUB (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6)))))) (newline) ;; --> #t

;;; 4. Add boolean operations ANND, ORR, NOTT
(write (calculate  '(NOT (GT (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6))))) (newline) ;; --> #t
(write (calculate '(AND (GT (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6)) (LE (ADD 3 (MUL 4 5)) (SUB 0 (SUB (ADD 3 4) (MUL 5 6))))) )) (newline) ;; --> #f

;;; 5. Add IPH

(write (calculate '(IPH (GT (ADD 3 4) 7) (ADD 1 2) (ADD 1 3)))) (newline) ;; -> 4
